Please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:districts@hofnarretje.eu">districts@hofnarretje.eu</a> to inform us about it.<br>
If we notice before you that a site is down, you will be informed via e-mail that we have taken down your site link. You will have 30 days to inform us about

<br> Make sure you have credible evidence (such as archive.is links) for the rule-breaking behavior. However, if you are found to make false accusations, you may be blacklisted from feDistricts.</details>

        <details><summary>Is there a way I can support feDistricts?</summary>

            <br>
            <details><summary>Why is the blacklist not public?</summary>
Maintaining a public blacklist would put us at a risk of being harassed. It is not something that should concern any parties other than feDistricts maintainers and the submitter(s).</details>
