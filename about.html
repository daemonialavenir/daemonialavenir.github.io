<h2>What are <i>feDistricts</i>?</h2>
feDistricts is an attempt to make a somewhat curated link directory of websites maintained by various
people on the Fediverse. The idea stems from GeoCities Districts and has seen its revival on both NeoCities and NekoWeb, each serving its own communities.<br>
<br>
The "districts" are merely thematical categories by which the websites are sorted. That is to 
make it easier to find what you want.<br>
<br>
Another goal of feDistricts is to bring the community together and to allow new people to meet each other.

<br><br>

Each website and its maintainer are manually checked to weed out malicious actors and those who engage in bigoted behaviors, including harassment and stalking.
