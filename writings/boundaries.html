    "Do not call me a nederboo" - a sentence that has become my new motto due to surge of people calling me one 
    or a sibling term (Dutch weeb is another one); even if these were in a positive manner, these felt like a thinly veiled
    instance of ableism.<br>
    Because for what other reason would you take someone openly autistic, their special interest 
    and compare it to a group of people known for often being bigoted, obsessed (in a bad way) and known for fetishizing a culture?<br><br>

    So I set a boundary. And it was great. Pretty much everyone stopped calling me one.<br>
    Because boundaries are supposed to be respected.<br><br>

    See, boundaries are one's sacred right, both in real life and online. <br>
    You don't have to understand a boundary in order to respect it. Sure, you will probably giggle at some because they may seem outlandish
    to you, but this is not an excuse to cross them under any condition.<br><br>
What seems miniscule, absurd, laughable to you can make an entire life to someone.<br><br>


And yes, if you violate someone's boundary, that person has full rights to be mad at you! It is not your goddamn right to whine like a baby
and cry wolf because someone was mean to you after you cross a line that has been set not once, not twice but thrice.
<br><br>
One may argue that hey, sometimes it's hard to do it in real life. And it's true. Sometimes you can't avoid interacting with certain people
no matter what.<br>
But online?<br><br>
If you got nothing to say and your purpose is to only cross lines, then don't engage at all, no matter how righteous your reason is.
<br>
It will make a whole day for someone.<br><br>
<b>Also: read people's profile bios on the internet. That helps a lot.</b>
