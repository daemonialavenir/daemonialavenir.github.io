    <h2 style="background-color: black; color:white; padding:10px; rotate:359deg;">We shall seek refuge among our own; no matter where on Earth is it.</h2>

    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 17px;">Nedercore (from <i>Neder[land]</i> + -core) is...</span>

    <h3>A statement of hope for a better life?</h3>
    <h3>The yearning of many who come here from their wasted homes?</h3>
    <h3>The impossible place between today and tomorrow?</h3>

    <h4 style="background-color: black; color:white; rotate:359deg; width:300px;">
    If we are to interpret what Nedercore stands for,<br>
we ought to look through the lens of an immigrant, one who seeks a better life in another place</h4>

<div style="background-color: white; width:600px; rotate:2deg; position:relative; top:-40px; right:-280px;">Nedercore draws and originates from the rose-tinted view<br>
of Western Europe by not only the immigrants from the Eastern Europe,<br>
who got the chance to experience a humane life; but it is also born out of<br>
the utopian view of the region as the near-perfection of what human society 
can be.</div>

<h4 style="background-color: black; color:white; rotate:359deg; width:300px; position: relative;top:-90px;">
Nedercore in itself is not a change, but rather welcomes the change with open arms; it isn't either a guarantee of the utopia</h4>

<div style="background-color: white; width:600px; rotate:2deg; position:relative; top:-130px; right:-280px;">
It is rather a sense of hope that we can at one point reach the goal; a transitionary period between "now" and "soon";
it may be no utopia, but it will be a beautiful world for everyone nonetheless
</div>

<h4 style="background-color: black; color:white; rotate:359deg; width:300px; position: relative;top:-130px;">
Nedercore rejects any strain of thought that inherently harms the poorest, puts the oppressors on a pedestal, enforces the 
limited hierarchy of the now</h4>
<div style="background-color: white; width:600px; rotate:2deg; position:relative; top:-180px; right:-280px;">
The radical acceptance of those who in the "now" got the short end of the stick is a great step into the utopia; we are individually capable of fostering a world for those who got outcasted by
the modern society.
    </div>
    <h2 style="background-color: black; color:white; padding:10px; rotate:1deg; position:relative;bottom:150px;">Nedercore is inherently anti-racist, anti-fascist, anti-ableist, anti-classist</h2>
<div style="background-color: white;position:relative;top:-140px;">It is the foundation to the utopia many on the left aspire for: from socialists to anarchists.<br>
We may not be in the perfect tomorrow, but we are able to lay the foundations for it.<br><br>
While we may not build the house, we may provide a safe ground for it to stand on without being<br>
bulldozed by the oppressive class.<br><br>
However, Nedercore also rejects political purity. We are all capable of mistakes.<br>
We extend hands to those who went into the dark paths and bring them back on our track into the future.<br><br>
We recognize that a common man is not born evil; but that the modern society formed them<br>
into the fascism's obedient student.</div>

<h2 style="background-color: black; color:white; padding:10px; rotate:359deg; position:relative;bottom:150px;">The gods of our modern world shall perish, and be casted into the bin</h2>
<h2 style="background-color: black; color:white; padding:10px; rotate:1deg; position:relative;bottom:150px;">We shall no longer praise power and assimilation on a pedestal</h2>
<h2 style="background-color: black; color:white; padding:10px; rotate:359deg; position:relative;bottom:150px;">The Future is an Immigrant; We Shall Welcome Future As Our Own</h2>
<h2 style="background-color: black; color:white; padding:10px; rotate:1deg; position:relative;bottom:150px;">The Future is a Queer; We Shall Embrace Future As Our Own</h2>
<h2 style="background-color: black; color:white; padding:10px; rotate:359deg; position:relative;bottom:150px;">The Future is Disabled; We Shall Accomodate Future As Our Own</h2><br>
<h2 style="background-color: black; color:white; padding:10px; rotate:0deg; position:relative;bottom:150px;">The Future is You; <br><br>We Shall Treat Future As Our Own</h2>
